This ipelet is meant to make it easier to make animations.

It currently provides only one function with shortcut Ctrl+Shift+J,
which makes a new view with a new active layer that contains a copy of
what is currently in the active layer.  In the new view, the currently
active layer is no longer visible, so by modifying the active layer,
you obtain the effect of an animation.
