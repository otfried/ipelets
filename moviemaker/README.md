This ipelet makes it easier to create animations.

It currently provides only one function "Next step" (with shortcut
Ctrl+Shift+J), which creates a new view where the currently active
layer has been replaced by an identical copy.  By modifying the active
layer in the new view, you obtain the effect of an animation.
